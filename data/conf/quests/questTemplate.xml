    <!-- PHASES TUTORIAL
		You can name phases whatever you want, as long as all phase names are UNIQUE.
    	You can have as many phases as you want: each phase corresponds to a different part of the quest. for example: 
    	phase one: talk to the quest giver, and accept the quest to go and fetch some items, 
    	phase two: bring that item to someone else, get some XP, 
    	phase three: bring that item and another item to a third person, 
    	phase four: bring back that item to the first NPC and complete the quest-->
    <phase name="phase1" npc="Here, enter the name of the NPC who hands out the phase">
		<collectables>
        	<!-- In collectables, you define what the player character must go and fetch for the quest giver, for each different item, add a item tag, 
        	and then add the name of the item and the quantity that needs to be brought to the NPC-->
        	<item name="insert the name of the item here. If there are spaces in the item name, put them here as well ("leather armor")" quantity="in here, write the quantity of that item. No decimals!"/>
      	</collectables>
      	
      	<!-- Handling keywords
			Keywords are shown in blue when the NPC says something. In order to make a keyword simply put a hashtag before the word (e.g. #keyword).
      		Keywords are used as triggers for specific NPC's dialogs. For instance, you have different types of dialogs messages that are triggered by keywords:
      		<reply key="keyword" message="message" />
      		<replyWithOffer key="keyword" message="" />
      		It is important to notice that the trigger word (keyword) do not need to be a keyword in a previous or later dialog at all. You can simply write it there. -->      		
      
      <!-- The following tags are used to start the quest, so make sure to put them only in the first phase.
      	   "replywithOffer" is used while the player did not accepted the quest neither rejected it. So you keep offering the quest. It is a more information tag before accepting or not the quest.
			"offerQuest" is used to offer the quest to the player if he din't start the quest yet or if he has already finished and the quest is repeatable. -->
      <offerQuest message="Here, add the message the NPC says to offer you the quest. dont forget to add a #"/>
      <replyWithOffer key="***" message="Secondary optional message that will be said only when quest hasnt been accepted and key *** is called" />
      
      <!-- Here, write messages the NPC will say depending on whether you accept or refuse the quest. No hashtags or keys needed.-->
      <questAccepted message="Here, add a message full of joy" />
      <questRefused message="Here, add a message full of disappointment" />

      <!-- The following messages happen when the quest is started but not completed
      "remindWithoutItem" reminds the player about the quest if he does not have all the items required when the player says hi. Can be used in any phase.
      "remindQuest" reminds the player about the quest if he says something about the quest (e.g. quest, task, etc) -->
      <remindWithoutItem message="here add a message that reminds the player of what he needs to do for the quest" />
      <remindQuest message="here add a message that reminds the player of what he needs to do for the quest" />
      
      <!-- Messages when the quest is completed
      "questCompleted" It is a greeting message (used when the player says hi) for when the player has already completed the quest.
      "replyCompleted" This message is triggered when the player says a keyword. For instance,if the quest is about fish and the player says fish
      you may like to add a reply for that. -->
      <questCompleted message="Here, add what the NPC must say when the quest is completed"/>
      <replyCompleted key="***" message="Here, add what the NPC says when the quest is complete."/>
      
      <!-- DO NOT forget to close the phase tag -->

	<!-- Second phase example -->
	<phase name="phase2" npc="Here, write the name of the NPC you need to take the items to">
		<!-- Handling rewards
      	If you want some rewards to be given at any phase during a quest, simply add the rewards tags.
      	The rewards will be given to the player as soon as he finishes the completeLastPhaseTag (to be explained later)
      	As for the collectables tags, you have to add an item name (with spaces if needed!) and a quantity. Do not forget
		that in Stendhal money is treated as item.
      	To give XP and karma just type xp and karma and the quantity. 
      	-->
		<rewards>
        	<item name="money" quantity="insert quantity here" />
        	<item name="xp" quantity="insert quantity here" />
        	<item name="karma" quantity="insert quantity here" />
        	<item name="whatever else" quantity ="whatever quantity"/>
      	</rewards>
      
		<!-- Complete Last Phase Talk
      	This tag is a link between the previous phase and the current one. This tag block is used to finish what the player should do in the
      	last phase. For instance, if in the previous phase he was supposed to get 10 apples and give them to Bob, this phase should have the
      	Bob NPC and inside the completeLastPhaseTalk shouuld have a greeting for completing the previous phase and chats related to that.
	      "drop" is referring to whether or not you should lose the previous collectables at this stage of the quest. 
    	  If they are to be dropped, write "true", if not, write "false"--> 
      	<completeLastPhaseTalk drop="here, write either "false" or "true"">
        	<greeting message="write the greeting the NPC will say" />
		</completeLastPhaseTalk drop="here, write either "false" or "true"">
