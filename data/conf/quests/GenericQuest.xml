    <!-- PHASES TUTORIAL
    You can name phases whatever you want, as long as all phase names are UNIQUE, and do not contain symbols or spaces. leave them as they are.
    You can have as many phases as you want: each phase corresponds to a different part of the quest. for example: 
    phase one: talk to the quest giver, and accept the quest to go and fetch some items, 
    phase two: bring that item to someone else, get some XP, 
    phase three: bring that item and another item to a third person, 
    phase four: bring back that item to the first NPC and complete the quest-->
    <phase name="phase1" npc="Here, enter the name of the NPC who hands out the quest">
      <collectables>
        <!-- In collectibles, you must define what the player character must go and fetch for the quest giver, for each different item, add a line, 
        and then add the name of the item and the quantity that needs to be brought to the NPC-->
        <item name="insert the name of the item here. If there are spaces in the item name, put them here as well ("leather armor")" quantity="in here, write the quantity of that item. no decimals!"/>
      </collectables>
      <!-- When writing the following messages, dont forget that you need to add link words between them by using a hashtag close to a word.
      For example, if you want the player character to go to the next dialogue segment when he says "love", you must add a "#love" in your first message.
      Then, you must add a following message with key = "love"-->
      
      <!-- Here, the first message is the one the NPC will say to give the quest to you. "replywithOffer" is used if you want the NPC to be able to give more info.
           Dont forget to add hashtags to offerQuest and replyWithOffer if you want to link them to other replyWithOffers and write the corresponding keys
           you can add as many replyWithOffers as you want.-->
